“We the members and associates of the Missouri University of Science and Technology’s Mars Rover Team establish this organization for the purpose of providing students with pertinent experience that will aid them in becoming tomorrow’s innovators and instigators. The purpose of the team is to pursue intercollegiate competitions that allow us to demonstrate our mastery of engineering processes and implementation. The Team hopes to inspire and empower students to enter fields of study in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, while creating a positive and educational environment for this development. The Team hopes to foster collaboration and communication across disciplines, while building lifelong skills such as organization, commitment, and leadership. Most importantly, the Mars Rover Team wishes to support and further technologies with applications in the field of space exploration, so that a unified humanity may step beyond its cradle, and embrace its birthright of the stars.”
