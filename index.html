              We design and build the next generation of Mars rovers that will one day work alongside human explorers in the field.

              The Missouri S&amp;T Mars Rover Design Team (MRDT) was established in 2012 to compete in the University Rover Challenge (URC) hosted by The Mars Society.  URC expects rovers to perform a number of tasks in the southern Utah desert in conditions analogous to those that would be expected in and around colonies on Mars.  In two short years we have become the leading Mars rover design team in the U.S., and second in the world.  This feat would not be possible without Missouri S&amp;T, the generosity of our sponsors, and the dedication of our members.<br><br>
              In the time between competitions, MRDT commits a year-long design, fabrication, and integration process.  MRDT operates completely on donations from sponsors and our university in order to see our rovers realized.  Our current rover is <i>Phoenix</i> (shown below) and is the rover that competed in URC 2014.  It features a water-jetted aluminum chassis, 3D-printed differential gears for the robotic arm, 7 lithium-polymer battery cells, and custom PCBs for communication, battery management, and power distribution, all of which have been designed entirely by members of MRDT.

              Donations to the team are monetary or in-kind.  In the past, donations-in-kind
              have come in the form of tools, materials, and consultancy.  Monetary donations are used by the team to acquire
              needed tools and materials for prototyping and fabrication, as well as to cover administrative costs for
              public relations and travel.  If you are interested in donating, please see our
